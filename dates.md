## Reviewing Schedule

ARR deadlines happen __every 2 months__, on the following dates: 10/15, 12/15, 2/15. In the past, deadlines were on the 15th of each month, and for a brief period, the [deadlines were every 6 weeks](https://aclrollingreview.org/six-week-cycles/), as of October 2022, we've moved to [every 2 months](https://aclrollingreview.org/key-changes-in-the-october-cycle/).

<!-- You can add these dates to your own calendar by subscribing to or downloading [this shared Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=dsa7ntvq7s9fah2f5e43tncmu8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). -->

## Submission to Participating Venues

Any paper that is not desk rejected will receive reviews. Once authors have reviews they may:
- revise and resubmit for another round of reviews (typically papers will go back to the same action editor and reviewers)
- submit their paper *and reviews* to a publication venue

Current publication venues participating in ARR are listed below. If you represent a publication venue and would like to be added to this list, please see [this page](https://aclrollingreview.org/organizers).
