# ðŸš¨ Call for contributors
The follow-up to the highly successful *SEACrowd* project is here! Become a co-author for SEA-VL: a community-driven project to create vision-language models for SEA languages, by SEA researchers!

<!-- ADD A SHORT BANNER HERE, SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A TWITTER BANNER WITH THE PROJECT NAME -->

#### What can I do for SEA-VL?
SEA-VL is a big project -- much larger than SEACrowd -- which is why we have decided to split it into two phases.

For Phase One, the task is to submit **self-taken culturally-relevant images**, plus descriptions about the shared image. This will be cleaned and compiled into a comprehensive dataset later on.

#### What's in it for me?
Like the previous SEACrowd project, contributions will be rewarded with points. Achieving X points will guarantee you a spot in our paper for Phase 1.

#### What is a "Culturally-relevant Image"?
Any image containing a subject relevant to your culture is accepted. For example, this can be food (ex. a photo of someone eating Nasi Goreng), places (ex. a scene from Escolta Street in Manila), events (ex. Chinese New Year celebration in your country), day-to-day life with culture-specific things (ex. eating with hands), and many more. As long as it contains something that's related to SEA culture, you can submit it.

#### Can I submit images from the internet?
**No.** Images have to be strictly taken by you.

Any images you provide will be later licensed under the open-source CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. Please make sure that the photos you submit do not belong to anyone else.

#### How do I join?
Submitting is easy! Simply access this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHKqaNlh-SvTD75AtWKkNhFvPNXXDy1eFyrqy3XGXq7M15Vw/viewform) and fill in the required details.

#### Do you have a group / online community that I can join in?
Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/SEACrowd) page, and join our Discord server. Everyone is welcome to discuss and ask questions there!

## FAQs
1. **The project has two phases. Does authorship in Phase One also guarantee authorship in Phase 2?** -- No. The points system for both phases will be different as both will involve different tasks. Points from Phase One will also not carry over into the next one.
2. **I have an image that is self-taken but I posted it on the internet before. Is this OK?** -- Yes, this is OK as long as (1) you took the image and (2) you did not release copyright to anyone else.
3. **Do the images have to be professional-quality?** -- No. Images from your phone are fine.
4. **I have images taken abroad that are culturally-releavant but they are not my culture. Is this OK?** -- Yes, this is OK. 
5. **I have other questions!** -- Please join our Discord server and let's discuss there!
