## My work

I graduated from Tampere University of Applied Sciences as a Bachelor of Business Administration (Computer Science) in 2018. Before graduating I started working at [Cybercom Group](https://www.cybercom.com/). I've worked in both public and private sectors. I'm currently working for a big Finnish industry customer as an software architect leading a team of developers.

### Skills & Interests

My studies focused on Java and Android native development. Since then I've moved towards web development and I consider myself a rather competent web developer / architect.

Obviously web development comes with a plenty of JavaScript / TypeScript knowledge. The thing that got me into web development was React with TypeScript and it is what I consider to be my biggest strength. In addition to React, I've also built applications with React native, Angular 2 and using vanilla JS. On the server side I've worked with Node.js, Spring, .NET Framework and .NET Core 2.

I'm AWS Certified Cloud Developer and I have some interest in the cloud technologies. I'm mostly interested in how using the public cloud can save developers time related to deployment and environment configuration.

## Other things I like to do

First of, I'm a huge dog person! I've got two dogs, a labrador retriever and a border collie. The lab is already 14 years old so she doesn't have that much energy anymore but the border collie requires tons of activies to keep him happy.

I've also been a gamer for more than 20 years. Currently I'm mostly enjoying strategy (Total War series) and Collectible Card Games (Eternal) with a little MOBA (League of Legends) on the side.

I also enjoy playing guitar and cooking.
