## Hi! I'm Austin
I'm currently a student at Stanford pursuing a dual Bachelors degree (B.S. Math + CS, B.A. Data Science) and coterminal Masters degree (M.S. Computational and Mathematical Engineering). I am broadly interested in uses of statistical computation on systems that run society, from solving biological problems to market making. I'm currently a computational research co-op at Moderna. My current research is on developing hyperscalable computational hit-finding models.

Other than that, I'm a perma-injured tennis player, semi-retired double bassist, and Google Maps doomscroller.

## I'd love to meet you!
