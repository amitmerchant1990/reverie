Wepa! Welcome to my Github Repo.

**About Me**

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico; and am a first-gen college student.  At a young age I became interested and passionate about mathematics - this being my favorite subject at school.  When the time came to decide what I wanted to do as a carreer going forward, my decisions where to study either Mathematics or Psychology as both topics were really appealing to me.  Participating in the Saturday Research Academy at the _Universidad Metropolitana_ in San Juan, P.R, I was able to do my first research in Biostatistics.  This was a pivotal moment in my life, as I learned that statistics applied to biology and medicine has an important and real life impact.

Therefore, I decided to pursue a bachelors degree in Applied Mathematics to Biology (as this was the closest curriculum to Statistics, avaliable in my university).  I graduated  May 2015 with a B.S having a first-author peer reviewed publication in Genetical Statistics and having also participated in 4 summer internships in various universities in the U.S.  In addition to, being an experienced 2 year Mentor Teacher at the same Research Academy that granted me so much.

Today, I hold a M.S in Statistics with a Data Science Track from the University of California, Davis. I have co-authored 2 papers with the Department of Health from Oasaka, Japan and the FDA.  In addition, possess 4 years working as a Data Scientist for one of the top Government Laboratories in the U.S and 4 more years of experience in product development in the biotech industry.  My skills have allow me to excel in jobs related to Data Science, Genomics, Teaching, Software Development and Project Management. 

My research interests are in: statistical genetics, bioinformatics, data mining and machine learning.  Overall, no matter what the application is, I am just passionate about data analysis and the insight data can gives us to solve real problems.  I am very passionate about my work, and like to bring a very positive attitute at work and to those that work around me.

**CS Skills:** Python, R, SQL, Bash, Perl.  Used to program in C++ and MatLab but it has been a long while.
